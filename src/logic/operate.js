/*
It should import the big.js module from the corresponding npm package.
It should implement one default function named operate.
The operate function should accept 
- numberOne, 
- numberTwo and 
- operation as arguments.
Using the value of the operation argument, this method should 
perform a simple math operation. For instance if operation == "-", 
it should return the result of subtracting the two passed numbers. 
Remember to wrap the numbers with big.js classes so you 
can operate on big numbers.
If the buttonName in calculate.js is equal to any operation 
(e.g. +, -, x, รท, %), operate.js should be used to 
calculate the total property.
