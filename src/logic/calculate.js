/*
Implement the calculate.js module
It should contain one default method: calculate.
The calculate method should accept a calculator data object
and a button name as arguments.
The calculator data object should contain three properties:
- total,
- next
- operation.
This method should use the buttonName argument to mutate
the calculator's data object and return its modified
version. For instance if buttonName == "+/-",
it should multiply total and next by -1 to make it negative
 or positive.
